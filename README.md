# Intro

Previously, *plutus* was built using Python/Django where everything was developed into a single monolithic architecture as a proof of concept. But now it's split into different services.

This will be backend service to only handle core bill service. Other might not necessarily be written in Java, but will be integrated together in a microservices fashion.
